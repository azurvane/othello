Perfect! Thatâ€™s a **very ambitious but extremely educational approach** â€” building Actor-Critic from scratch in C++ without relying on libraries like PyTorch will teach you **exact neural network mechanics, gradient calculations, and RL fundamentals** deeply.

Hereâ€™s a roadmap tailored for a **fully custom C++ Actor-Critic Othello AI**, while using only basic libraries for math/containers:

## **Actor-Critic from Scratch Roadmap (C++)**

### **Stage 1: Environment Abstraction**

You already have `GameEngine`. Refactor it slightly for RL:

1. **State Representation**

    * Convert the board into a numerical representation:

        * 1 = Black
        * -1 = White
        * 0 = Empty
    * Flatten 8Ã—8 to 64-length vector (or leave as 2D array for CNN-like approaches later).

2. **Action Space**

    * Map moves to integers: 0â€“63.
    * Provide a method to return legal moves (`vector<int>`).

3. **Step Function**

    * Apply a move and return:

        * `next_state` (numerical board)
        * `reward` (float)
        * `done` (bool, whether game ended)

4. **Reset Function**

    * Resets board and returns initial state.

### **Stage 2: Neural Network Implementation**

Since youâ€™re building from scratch:

1. **Network Structure**

    * Actor: outputs probabilities over actions.
    * Critic: outputs scalar value of state V(s).

2. **Layer Components**

    * Fully connected layers (FC)
    * Activation functions: ReLU, Tanh, Softmax
    * Forward pass
    * Backward pass (manual gradient computation)

3. **Parameter Storage**

    * Use `std::vector<std::vector<float>>` for weights.
    * Store biases separately.

---

### **Stage 3: Forward and Backward Propagation**

1. **Forward**

    * Actor outputs action probabilities via softmax.
    * Critic outputs V(s).

2. **Backward**

    * Actor: gradient of log(pi(a|s)) \* advantage
    * Critic: gradient of (target - V(s))Â²

3. **Weight Update**

    * Implement **gradient descent**:

      ```text
      w = w - lr * dw
      ```
    * Keep separate learning rates for actor and critic.

---

### **Stage 4: Actor-Critic Algorithm**

1. **Sample action**

    * Mask illegal moves.
    * Sample according to actor probabilities.

2. **Take action**

    * Use `GameEngine.Step(action)`.

3. **Compute reward and advantage**

   ```text
   advantage = reward + gamma * V(next_state) - V(current_state)
   ```

4. **Update Actor and Critic**

    * Actor: move probability gradient weighted by advantage.
    * Critic: MSE loss between predicted V(s) and target.

5. **Repeat until done**

    * At the end of the game, reset environment.

---

### **Stage 5: Training Loop**

1. Loop over episodes:

    * Reset game
    * Play until game ends
    * Collect trajectories
    * Update networks after each move or at the end of episode

2. Track performance:

    * Win rate vs random AI
    * Average reward
    * Policy improvement

---

### **Stage 6: Optimizations**

* Entropy regularization â†’ encourages exploration
* Discount factor `gamma` tuning
* Separate learning rates for actor and critic
* Gradient clipping (to avoid exploding gradients)
* Self-play: AI plays against its own policy for faster learning

---

### **Stage 7: Testing and Evaluation**

* Test policy against:

    * Random AI
    * Greedy AI
* Log:

    * Move distributions
    * Rewards per game
    * Actor loss and critic loss
* Save and reload network parameters (serialize to file).

---

### **Stage 8: C++ Specific Considerations**

1. **Memory Management**

    * Use `std::vector` for all matrices and states.
    * Avoid raw pointers unless necessary.
2. **Performance**

    * Flatten 2D board for faster matrix multiplication.
    * Pre-allocate all arrays to avoid repeated memory allocation.
3. **Numerical Stability**

    * Softmax: subtract max before exp
    * Clamp gradients to prevent exploding values.

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** Start small:

1. Implement a **tiny neural network** (64â†’16â†’64 for Actor, 64â†’16â†’1 for Critic).
2. Verify forward/backward pass manually (simple test with known outputs).
3. Implement the **step function in `GameEngine`** to interact with your network.
4. Then start full Actor-Critic training loop.

If you want, I can now draw a **diagram of the complete flow** showing how your **GameEngine, Actor, Critic, and training loop interact**, fully in C++. It will help you organize your classes and functions before coding.

Do you want me to do that?
